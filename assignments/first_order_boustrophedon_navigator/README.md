I first started with self.Kp_linear = 1.0 # Proportional gain for linear velocity self.Kd_linear = 0.1 # Derivative gain for linear velocity self.Kp_angular = 1.0 # Proportional gain for angular velocity self.Kd_angular = 0.1 # Derivative gain for angular velocity

To achieve smooth and precise path-following

For linear velocity (Kp_linear), I set it to 5.0. This value provided a good balance between speed and stability, preventing the turtle from overshooting while maintaining reasonable speed. For angular velocity (Kp_angular), I increased to 5.0, which allowed the turtle to correct its orientation quickly so that it makes shart turns and stay on course during turns, but the turn was not sharp enough.

For linear velocity (Kd_linear) and angular velocity (Kd_angular), I set both to 0.01. This small value helped smooth out the turtle's movement and prevent jerky motions or overshooting as it approached waypoints. Through iterative testing, I found that self.Kp_linear = 4.0 # Proportional gain for linear velocity self.Kd_linear = 0.001 # Derivative gain for linear velocity self.Kp_angular = 10.0 # Proportional gain for angular velocity self.Kd_angular = 0.001 # Derivative gain for angular velocity these values minimized average cross-track error of 0.073 while ensuring the turtle followed the waypoints efficiently without instability.

In this assignment, you will understand the provided code in ROS2 with Turtlesim, and refactor and/or tune the navigator to implement a precise lawnmower survey (a boustrophedon pattern). The current code will do a pattern shown above, which is not a uniform lawnmower survey. 
Explore literature on how lawnmower surveys typically look, and modify the code to meet the requirements for a uniform survey. 

## Background
Boustrophedon patterns (from Greek: "ox-turning", like an ox drawing a plow) are fundamental coverage survey trajectories useful in space exploration and Earth observation. These patterns are useful for:

- **Space Exploration**: Rovers could use boustrophedon patterns to systematically survey areas of interest, ensuring complete coverage when searching for geological samples or mapping terrain. However, due to energy constraints, informative paths are usually optimized, and this results in paths that are sparser than complete coverage sampling, and may still produce high-accuracy reconstructions. 
  
- **Earth Observation**: Aerial vehicles employ these patterns for:
  - Agricultural monitoring and precision farming
  - Search and rescue operations
  - Environmental mapping and monitoring
  - Geological or archaeological surveys
  
- **Ocean Exploration**: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use boustrophedon patterns to:
  - Map the ocean floor
  - Search for shipwrecks or aircraft debris
  - Monitor marine ecosystems
  
The efficiency and accuracy of these surveys depend heavily on the robot's ability to follow the prescribed path with minimal deviation (cross-track error). This assignment simulates these real-world challenges in a 2D environment using a first-order dynamical system (the turtlesim robot).

## Objective
Tune a PD controller to make a first-order system execute the most precise boustrophedon pattern possible. The goal is to minimize the cross-track error while maintaining smooth motion.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding PD control parameters and their effects on first-order systems
- Practical experience with controller tuning
- Analysis of trajectory tracking performance
- ROS2 visualization and debugging
